# NeeSees-Free-Shipping-Notification
This is a real-time free shipping calculator implemented on a Shopify store.

It is visible on all product pages and updated when items are added or removed from the cart, even if the page is not reloaded. It displays how much more the visitor needs to spend in order to unlock free shipping. Once they hit the minimum threshold, displays a message letting the visitor know they have unlocked the free shipping.
